# Run params
Select:  # boolean expression to select fields with specific property. ex: group == 1, area < 6
Range: [0, 0.25] # The portion of selected fields to run simulations on. 0 to 1 is for all of them.
num_of_workers: 40 # No. of parellel processes. Should be less than number of cpu cores.
timeout: 5 # No. of seconds to let a simulation run. Execution is terminated after timeout.

# Post Process
Process_outputs: ./post_process.py reduce_outputs # if not empty during runs, output processing is also carried out.
visualize: ./post_process.py spatial_plot # specify function to visualize the required results
