Visit the following URL: [https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/index.php](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/index.php) to download the 'Crop Sequence Boundaries 2016-2023' dataset. After downloading, extract the dataset, which includes crop-field shapefiles for the entire USA. You can then clip these shapefiles to fit your Area of Interest (AOI).

Example: If your research focuses on Maryland, clip the shapefiles for Maryland and save it.
