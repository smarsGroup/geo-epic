This repository contains the code for a tool that provides nitrogen recommendations for wheat farmers in Kansas and Oklahoma. The tool uses data on fertilizer amount, weather conditions, and crop management practices to make accurate and specific recommendations for nitrogen application. Getting Started These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine and on the GEOG cluster for development and testing purposes. Prerequisites Node.js Latest LTS Version: 18.15.0 (includes npm 9.5.0) Setup Instructions and Available Scripts Instructions to set up the website in your local environment: Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:\\ Install dependencies using node package manager:\\ npm install \\ To run the app in development mode, in your project directory: \\ npm start Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.\\ You will also see any lint errors in the console. To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode: \\ npm test See the section about running tests for more information. Instructions to set up the website on the GEOG cluster and access the website on your local machine: Clone the repository to your folder on the cluster. Install PuTTY on your local machine. Open PuTTY and in the Session's window enter the cluster's hostname or IP address and the port number of the destination SSH server. Make sure the connection type is set to SSH. In the left sidebar under the Category options. Navigate to the Connection >> SSH >> Tunnels. Select Local to define the type of SSH port forward. In the Source port field, enter the port number on which the frontend application in running. (Example - Source port: 3000). In the Destination field, enter the destination address followed by the port number. (Example - Destination: localhost:3000). Click Add to add the port forward. Similarly, add another port forward for the backend application. (Example - Source port: 4000, Destination: localhost:4000). Click Open to establish the connection. The tunnel will work until the SSH session is active. Run the following commands:\\ module load node \\ export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 \\ fuser -n tcp -k 3000 \\ fuser -n tcp -k 5000 Navigate to the \"react_leaflet\" and \"socket_server\" project directories in separate terminals and run the following commands:\\ npm install \\ npm start Open http://localhost:3000 to view the website in the browser. Deployment The website is deployed on AWS using Simple Storage Service (S3). Instructions to deploy the website on AWS S3: Run the following command: npm run build Navigate to the nitrogen-recommendation-tool S3 bucket. Empty the bucket. Delete all the contents of the bucket. Upload the contents of the \"build\" folder in the project directory to the S3 bucket. Cloudfront distribution link of the website.
