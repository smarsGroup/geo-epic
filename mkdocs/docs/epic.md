## ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY INTEGRATED CLIMATE MODEL

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, originally known as the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator, is designed to simulate a field, farm or small watershed, that is homogenous in terms of climate, soil, land use, and topography. EPIC helps in analyzing the effects of management strategies on soil erosion and extends to other aspects of agricultural sustainability like water quality, plant competition, and pest control. 

Initially developed in the early 1980s, (J. R. Williams,
Jones, & Dyke, 1984). EPIC integrated components from previous models such as CREAMS (Knisel, 1980) and SWRRB (J. R. Williams, Nicks, & Arnold, 1985). The model was later enhanced with a pesticide component from GLEAMS (Leonard, 1987) to assess pesticide fate, further developed by Sabbagh, Geleta, Elliott, Williams, & Griggs (1991). EPICâ€™s capabilities include evaluating management strategies like irrigation, fertilization, crop rotation, and pesticide application. EPIC has evolved to address broader issues such as global climate change impacts, biomass production for energy, and landfill design, making it a versatile tool in environmental and agricultural management.

The EPIC model offers high temporal resolution, simulating agricultural systems on a daily basis over long periods. It features refined algorithms for water quality, nutrient cycling, climate impacts, and atmospheric CO2 effects. This adaptable model evaluates various cropping and management practices to optimize agricultural strategies and calculate erosion costs.
