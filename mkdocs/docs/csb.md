Go to https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/index.php and Download the Crop Sequence Boundaries 2016-2023 dataset and extract it. This crop sequence boundary contains the crop-field shapefiles for whole USA. You can clip it for your AOI. 

Example: If you are working in Maryland state, just clip it for Maryland and keep it in a new folder named 'CropRotations'.
